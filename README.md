# Lab Booking System
 Open source sample code using modern C++.
## Background
This Lab bookign system is my first C++ project inspired by uni life. Lab computers are hard to find when exams are coming. A booking system could be used to reduce conflict.

Lab booking system is written in C++ using modern techniques including auto type inference, range-based iteration and tuple.
## Framework

## Dependency
Lab booking system has no runtime dependencies. This project is built on Embarcadero Dev-C++ 6.3 with compiler GCC 9.2.0 supporting C++17. It will run in any environment that can run C++17 programs.
To build the test from source you need to create makefiles or project and solution files for other compilers.
This repository contains a complete example program which can be used to test all functions.
## License
Open source and free to use.
